# PyImageCropper
A simple python program to bulk crop images automatically

## Who, what, where, when and why?
1. Me, Aaron Barratt
2. Python3 using tkinter for the UI and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for the image manipulation
3. Right here. I am based in the UK
4. I use a 32:9 monitor and taking steam screenshots would result in huge pillar boxes: ![elden ring 32:9 screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/c3lztQe.jpeg) After hundreds of these piled up I didn't want to manually crop them myself. I thought I would test out my Python skills to do so this for me

I am sure there are a million other ways/programs to do this. I just wanted to learn Python and make something useful for myself at the same time
